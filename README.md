Weather App 

This is my first project in Python, a Weather App that provides weather information for any city entered by the user. The app fetches live weather data from a website using an API and displays the current temperature, wind flow, cloud condition, and region of the city.

Usage :

To use the Weather App, simply enter the name of the city you wish to retrieve weather information for, and the app will display the relevant data on the screen.

Installation : 

To run the Weather App, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository and run the weather.py file in your terminal.

Copy code :

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/weather-app.git

cd weather-app

python weather.py

Future Improvements : 

In the future, I plan to enhance this app by adding more detailed weather information, including historical data, forecasts, and alerts. I am excited to continue working with Python and exploring its capabilities in developing more exciting projects..
